/* The system's storage management strategy assumes that space becomes
   free for one of two reasons: "young" allocations are freed because
   they either fail to commit or are deleted while still "hot." "Old"
   allocations are also freed when they are archived to the OLAP
   store.

   We therefore have two sets of files:

   The "log" is the site of all new storage allocation, and is divided
   into sixteen regions. From oldest to newest:

   [clean] [cleaning] [cold] ... [cooling] [active]

   Whenever the active segment fills, the system will "open" a new
   segment by taking over the space occupied by the oldest segment
   (which must be [clean]). Cleaning involves moving all live records
   from the segment to the "heap." These cannot be write-hot (if they
   are still live after this long), but may still be read-hot (and
   therefore unsuitable for archiving). We move these records to the
   heap to avoid unnecessary write amplification during log cleaning.

   In order to prevent the log from becoming wedged, we maintain the
   invariant that there must always be enough space in the [active]
   segment (plus any [clean] segments) to absorb the checkpoint and
   relocation records that would be required to clean an entire
   [cold] segment. To avoid blocking log insertions during bursts of
   log traffic, the system attempts to clean old segments fast enough
   to maintain a tunable number of empty segments. Keeping more empty
   segments allows larger bursts to be absorbed, but wastes space and
   increases write amplification (because objects have less time to be
   invalidated before they have to be moved).

   The heap is also divided into regions, similar to the log. The only
   significant change is that cleaning moves records to the head of
   the heap, rather than to a third location. The archiving process,
   which is completely independent, will eventually drain records from
   the heap. In order to detect that the heap is filling faster than
   the archiving process drains it, we maintain two "active" segments:
   the proper [active] segment is the destination for records
   reclaimed from the log. A secondary [receiving] segment records
   reclaimed from the end of the heap. When the [active] segment
   fills, it takes over the [receiving] segment; if the latter is over
   half full at the time it becomes [active], it would indicate that
   new records are arriving faster than they are being archived.

   NOTE: the system allows changes to the log and heap file sizes, but
   the changes take effect gradually: Whenever a new segment is
   opened, it takes the size then configured. With 16 segments to each
   file, it would make little difference (while adding significant
   complexity) to truncate or expand an already-active segment, as the
   latter represents only 6% of the total log/heap space.
