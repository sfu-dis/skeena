/* The log recovery manager.

   To avoid confusion and errors, we have to recover the existing log
   and checkpoints before we instantiate the part of the log capable
   of generating new records for the system.

   When it comes to testing and implementation, this class breaks the
   usual order of abstraction. We can't really test recovery until we
   have a reliable way to create log records, so sm_log_alloc_mgr
   (which uses this class) has to be tested first. Fortunately,
   there's little to be done here for a freshly created log, so we can
   get sm_log_alloc_mgr working before all the kinks have been ironed
   out here.

     records, than this. Oversized records must be stored in another
     file and logged as relocations, and blocks with too many
     entries must overflow (careful to always reserve enough space
     for an overflow record!).

     The restriction is largely arbitrary, serving mostly to bound
     the size of the buffer required during log recovery.

     The block size sets the size of the buffer used to validate
     checksums. The record count controls the buffer space needed to
     reinstall records during startup.
