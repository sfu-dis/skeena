/* An efficient implementation of the adler32 checksum algorithm.

   One really nice feature of adler32 (in addition to its speed) is
   that checksums compose: given N bytes to process, we can compute
   the checksum for the first M bytes separately from the remaining
   N-M bytes. We can then combine two adjacent checksums as long as we
   know the length of the second (right hand) data block.

   Vanilla (scalar) implementation courtesy of
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/421419/good-choice-for-a-lightweight-checksum-algorithm

   If SSSE3 or better is available, a vectorized version of adler32
   beats the optimized scalar version by anywhere from ~2x (for a few
   dozen bytes) to nearly 9x (for tens of kB or more). Achieving
   speedup better than 8x is especially impressive, given that the SSE
   implementation works with 8x16-bit values internally. For a workload that
   fits
   in cache, the SSE variant can surpass 12 GB/s. Obviously memory
   bandwidth limitations, or short runs, might eat into that
   throughtput.

   WARNING: adler32 is wickedly fast, but has several significant
   weaknesses [1]. Perhaps the most troubling one for our purposes is
   the fact that it performs poorly for small inputs (where "small" is
   sub-kB range).
